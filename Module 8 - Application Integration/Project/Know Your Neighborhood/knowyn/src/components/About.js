              Know Your Neighborhood is an application that aims to provide
              detailed information about all the stores in your neighborhood.
              Founded in 2021, our platform is the brainchild of Pratama, who
              recognized the need to bring valuable information about local
              businesses to the community.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our adventure started with the idea of developing a product that
              empowers people by providing them with access to complete
              information about the stores nearby. In order to help people make
              educated decisions and support their local economy, we intended to
              close the gap between neighborhood businesses and the local
              community.
            </p>
            <p>
              Know Your Neighborhood is all about connecting people with their
              local community and empowering them with the knowledge of what's
              available in their area. With our application, you can easily
              discover a wide range of stores, including boutiques, grocery
              stores, and more. We provide essential details such as contact
              information, and the location to help you make informed choices.
              By using our application, you can support local businesses,
              explore new places, and foster a sense of belonging within your
              neighborhood.
